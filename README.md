# Number Guessing Game

## Overview
This C++ program is a simple number guessing game where the player has to guess a random number within a specified range. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and allows the player a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: The program generates a random number within a specified range using the `rand()` function from the `<cstdlib>` library.
- **User Interaction**: The player is prompted to input their guess, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Limited Attempts**: The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number, with a hint provided after a certain number of attempts.
- **Customizable Range**: The range for the random number can be customized by the user.

## How to Use
1. **Compile the Program**: Compile the C++ source code (`number_guessing_game.cpp`) using a C++ compiler.
    ```
    g++ number_guessing_game.cpp -o number_guessing_game
    ```
2. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled binary to run the number guessing game.
    ```
    ./number_guessing_game
    ```
3. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: Enter your name, specify the range for the number, and start guessing the number.
